# AssetCalculator
This calculates your total assets and has a feature to output it as a text file or as visual graphs to understand where all your money is. It also has a feature to calculate the live result for your stocks

### *! Quick Note, you need to create two extra files that I was unable to import, first one is a "credentials.txt" and the second one is a "Price.csv"

Difficulty of project: (Medium)


Purpose of the project:

I created this project because I wanted to practice text file handling skills. It is a topic that has information all over the place on a lot of different websites and not in one section. As a result this made me want to practice as many different parts of file handling in python as possible (Without needing to import any modules).

As a result I came up with the idea to create a Asset calculator that will take in as many assets from the user as they want (Such as banks, Investments, Other (Cars, houses, etc)) and compile it all into one big file that is easy for the user to read and have a report on their total Assets. It also contains the ability to display this information graphically for those who prefer that. I have also implemented a web scraping function that fetches information from yahoo finance using Pandas Data Sources and calculated a “Live Result” feature to tell you how much you are up or down depending on your previous stock profile information.


All main functions in the project:

This project has quite a lot of main functions, it also has a lot of helper functions for these main functions.

These include:
- Login system
- Registration system
- Bank portfolio 
- Investment portfolio
- Investment Accounts
- Other Assets
- Asset calculator
- Create report
  - Graphical or Text
- Logout Function





Useful Functions in the project:

This project has some interesting functions all built on the file handling section of python with any imports.

These include:
- Registration System
- Login System
- File manipulating functions
- Logout function
- Graphical representation using Matplotlib
- The use of Pandas to store data in a data frame and also scrape data from a certain data source provided


Skills learnt whilst making this project:

Whilst making this project, I got accustomed to how file handling really works, I learn’t new keywords and syntax when it came to file handling. I also learn’t how to do file manipulation.

I also learn’t some of the basics from Pandas and Matplotlib
